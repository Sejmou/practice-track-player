# Media Player for Musicians
This repo contains code for a web-based media player, geared especially towards musicians that like to practice along to audio files or YouTube videos.

## Features

### Audio Player

I created a player for audio files that (apart from regular player controls) features a waveform view of the audio file(s) and also allows you to loop a certain part of the audio file or adapt the tempo.

### YouTube Player

The web app also includes a player for YouTube videos with similar features. Just paste a link to a video or public playlist and you're ready to go! Alternatively, you may also login to your YouTube account to play videos from your own playlists.

### Musicals

From October 2022 to June 2023, I had the honor to be part of the on-stage choir in the musical play [The Hunchback of Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_(musical)) at the Ronacher musical theater in Vienna.

As I needed a more efficient way to practice my parts for the 25+ songs, I created a section on this web app specifically for that. It features practice tracks for all the songs of the musical and several parts/voices (i.e. all the roles of the cast + the parts for the choir, split by voice). The audio was extracted from YouTube videos embedded on [musicalpracticetracks.com](https://www.musicalpracticetracks.com/index.php/the-hunchback-of-notre-dame/) (which is a great website, but unfortunately a bit 'outdated' and quite clunky to use). Note: I am aware that what I did might not be 100% legal, but I hope this can be considered 'fair use' - I don't make any money with this website, and it sure helped me (and possibly others) a lot!

## Developer Notes
